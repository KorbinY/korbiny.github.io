  <p>
    I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, 
    advised by Dr. Hui Liu and Dr. Jiliang Tang. My research interests lie in 
    <b>Large Language Models (LLMs)</b>, <b>AI for Education</b>, and <b>Computational Social Science</b>, 
    with a focus on developing reasoning methods and evaluating LLMs in real-world educational and social contexts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to my Ph.D., I received an M.S. in Applied Statistics and a B.A. in Sociology from Fudan University, China. 
    I have published multiple first-author papers at top conferences and actively serve as a reviewer for major AI/ML conferences and jornals.
