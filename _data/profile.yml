  <p>
    I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, 
    advised by Dr. Hui Liu and Dr. Jiliang Tang. My research interests lie in 
    <b>Large Language Models (LLMs)</b>, <b>Computational Social Science</b>, and <b>AI for Education</b>, with a focus on developing reasoning methods and evaluating LLMs in real-world social and educational contexts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before starting my Ph.D., I earned an M.S. in Applied Statistics and a B.A. in Sociology from Fudan University, China.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have published several first-author papers and actively serve as a reviewer for leading AI/ML conferences and journals.
